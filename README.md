Install it globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 2. **Set Up Firebase for Local Development**
To run Firebase locally, you'll use the Firebase Emulator Suite. Set up the Firebase Emulator for Authentication, Firestore, and Realtime Database:

#### 2.1 Initialize Firebase Project Locally
In your project directory, run:
```bash
firebase init
```
- Choose Firebase services you want to initialize (Authentication, Realtime Database, Firebase Functions, etc.).
- Configure the Firebase Emulator (select the services you need to emulate).
  
#### 2.2 Start Firebase Emulators
To start the Firebase emulators, run the following:
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```
This will start the local emulators for Realtime Database, Firestore, Authentication, and other Firebase services.

---

### 3. **Run the Flutter Frontend Locally**

#### 3.1 Set Up Firebase in Flutter
- Open your Flutter project in VS Code and ensure that you've added Firebase dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's an example:
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    cupertino_icons: ^1.0.0
    firebase_core: ^1.10.0
    firebase_auth: ^4.0.0
    firebase_database: ^9.0.0
    firebase_storage: ^10.0.0
    firebase_messaging: ^11.0.0
    google_maps_flutter: ^2.1.0
    geolocator: ^8.0.0
    location: ^4.0.0
  ```

- Initialize Firebase in your app by modifying the `main.dart` file to ensure Firebase is initialized before the app starts:
  ```dart
  import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

  void main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Firebase.initializeApp();
    runApp(MyApp());
  }
  ```

#### 3.2 Run the Flutter App
Once your Firebase setup is done and the emulator is running, you can run the app locally:
```bash
flutter run
```

Ensure your device (or emulator) is connected and running to view the app.

---

### 4. **Run the Python Backend Locally**

#### 4.1 Set Up the Backend (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Flask Example** (app.py):
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  import firebase_admin
  from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

  app = Flask(__name__)

  # Initialize Firebase Admin SDK
  cred = credentials.Certificate('path/to/your/firebase-admin-sdk.json')
  firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

  db = firestore.client()

  @app.route('/api/ride/request', methods=['POST'])
  def create_ride():
      data = request.get_json()
      # Add ride details to Firestore or Realtime DB
      db.collection('rides').add(data)
      return jsonify({"message": "Ride request created!"}), 200

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

- **FastAPI Example** (main.py):
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore, initialize_app

  # Firebase setup
  cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/your/firebase-admin-sdk.json")
  initialize_app(cred)

  app = FastAPI()
  db = firestore.client()

  class RideRequest(BaseModel):
      user_id: str
      driver_id: str
      location: str
      status: str

  @app.post("/api/ride/request")
  async def create_ride(ride: RideRequest):
      db.collection('rides').add(ride.dict())
      return {"message": "Ride request created!"}

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      import uvicorn
      uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
  ```

#### 4.2 Run the Backend Locally
- For **Flask**:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

- For **FastAPI**:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

The Python backend should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Flask) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (FastAPI).

---

### 5. **Testing and Debugging Locally**
- **Testing Firebase Functions**: You can test Firebase functions locally by using the Firebase Emulator.
- **Test Backend API**: Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to send requests to your local Python backend API endpoints.

Example:
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/ride/request
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "driver_id": "456",
  "location": "123 Main St",
  "status": "requested"
}
```

---

### 6. **Final Check**
- Ensure Firebase emulators are running in the terminal (`firebase emulators:start`).
- Make sure both your Flutter frontend and Python backend are properly connected to Firebase and are handling requests correctly.

Now you can run **SafeRide** locally on both the frontend and backend, test the functionalities, and make changes as needed before deploying to production!### Usage Example for **SafeRide** üöñ
