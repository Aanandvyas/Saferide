## API References for **SafeRide**

Here are the key APIs used in **SafeRide**, including Firebase, Google Maps, and the custom Python backend:

---

### 1. Firebase Realtime Database API

- **Firebase Realtime Database** allows us to store and sync data between users in real-time. We use it for storing ride details, user profiles, and driver statuses.
- **Reference**: [Firebase Realtime Database Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)

**Common Methods**:
- `firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').set(data)`: Set data at a specific path.
- `firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').on('value', callback)`: Listen for real-time updates at a path.
- `firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').push(data)`: Add new data to the database.
- `firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').remove()`: Remove data from the database.

---

### 2. Firebase Authentication API

- **Firebase Authentication** handles user sign-up, login, and authentication.
- **Reference**: [Firebase Authentication Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

**Common Methods**:
- `firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)`: Sign in an existing user.
- `firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)`: Register a new user.
- `firebase.auth().signOut()`: Sign the user out.

---

### 3. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** allows sending push notifications to users.
- **Reference**: [Firebase Cloud Messaging Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)

**Common Methods**:
- `firebase.messaging().getToken()`: Retrieve the FCM token for push notifications.
- `firebase.messaging().onMessage(callback)`: Handle foreground messages (notifications while app is open).
- `firebase.messaging().setBackgroundMessageHandler(callback)`: Handle background messages (when the app is in the background or terminated).

---

### 4. Google Maps API

- **Google Maps API** is used for displaying maps, geolocation, and route planning (driver/rider matching and live location tracking).
- **Reference**: [Google Maps SDK for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)

**Common Methods**:
- `GoogleMap()`: Widget to display the map.
- `GoogleMapController.animateCamera()`: Animate the camera (for example, move to the user‚Äôs location).
- `Geolocator.getCurrentPosition()`: Get the user‚Äôs current location.
- `Geolocator.getPositionStream()`: Stream real-time location updates.

---

### 5. Geolocator API

- **Geolocator** is used for retrieving the current location of the user or driver and tracking changes in location.
- **Reference**: [Geolocator Plugin Documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator)

**Common Methods**:
- `Geolocator.getCurrentPosition()`: Get the current position of the user.
- `Geolocator.getPositionStream()`: Get real-time location updates.
- `Geolocator.isLocationServiceEnabled()`: Check if location services are enabled.

---

### 6. Python Backend API (Custom Backend)

- The Python backend uses **Flask** or **FastAPI** for creating REST APIs to handle requests like booking rides, processing payments, and updating driver statuses.

**Example Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/ride/request`: Accept a ride request from the user and save it to the Firebase database.
- `GET /api/ride/driver-status`: Get the status of the nearest available driver for the user.
- `POST /api/ride/cancel`: Cancel a ride and update the ride status in the database.

**Python Libraries Used**:
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Framework for building REST APIs.
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: Used to interact with Firebase from the backend (e.g., storing/retrieving data, sending notifications).

**References**:
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Firebase Admin SDK for Python](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)

---

### 7. Rash Driving Detection API (Custom Logic)

- The rash driving detection uses the device‚Äôs accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect erratic movements, such as sudden acceleration or hard braking, which may indicate rash driving.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Sensors Plugin**: `sensors_plus` package is used to access device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope).
  - **Machine Learning**: You can integrate a model for anomaly detection that analyzes the sensor data to predict rash driving behavior.

**Reference**: [sensors_plus Flutter Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/sensors_plus)

---

## Conclusion

These APIs power the core functionalities of **SafeRide**, including real-time ride tracking, user authentication, push notifications, location services, and backend processing. By leveraging these tools, we can provide a seamless and secure experience for both drivers and riders.
